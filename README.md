# BlueSCSI v1 Updater

> [!NOTE]
> You probably want BlueSCSI v2 update instructions here: <https://bluescsi.com/docs/Updating-Firmware>

These scripts served their purpose, but we now recommend [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox) to easily update via USB.


## Old README.md

The code is still here if you need to flash - see the [README-old.md](README-old.md) for those instructions.
